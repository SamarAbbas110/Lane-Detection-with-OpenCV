# Lane Detection with OpenCV

This project implements a lane detection system using OpenCV in Python. It detects lane markings in videos, making it suitable for applications in autonomous vehicle systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

## Features

- Detects lane markings in videos.
- Utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
- Implements Canny edge detection and Hough transform.
- Calculates average slope and intercept to determine lane boundaries.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/lane-detection.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install opencv-python`
3. Run the `lanes.py` script with a test video file as input.
4. View the processed video with detected lane markings.
